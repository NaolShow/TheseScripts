# TheseScripts
TheseScripts is a software developed by NaolShow [FR] (ToWolf http://towolf.livehost.fr/)

TheseScripts was created to facilitate the installation of scripts for the Mod Tools of Call of Duty: Black Ops 3,
and to help beginners install these scripts. (And so save time)

TheseScripts was created in C#, so it is available on: [(You must have .NET Framework)](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download)
- Windows
- Linux with the Mono project (Really not recommended)
